After my topic modelling study on the Freakonomics Radio Podcast, I was interested to see what I could do with some data from the French
President.  
In the article that you'll find [here](https://medium.com/@nathancohenil/understanding-emmanuel-macrons-words-with-numbers-33e1916b73b), you
can read about the subjects he discusses the most, some hidden subjects, the key-words influencing his popularity ratings, and even read
a bit from **MacronBot**, a text generator inspired from DeepDrumpf.

Enjoy reading !
