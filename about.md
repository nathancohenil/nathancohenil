I studied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Microengineering respectively in France and in Switzerland for five years. As I was studying I was teaching Mathematics to high school students ( junior to senior ). I took as much as I could from this experience and really enjoyed teaching and talking in public. I left Switzerland a while ago to keep on challenging myself and to push my limits. Since then, I have been working on Data Science projects that I write mostly in Python and ( sometimes ) in R.

I **LOVE** working with medical data for Computer Assisted Diagnosis projects, so you can expect to find a few of these here.  
I'm also very interested in social data and text data, you'll see a few language studies on this blog as well.

On this site you will find reports of the forementioned projects, cool data visualisations and blog posts about pretty much anything I do that relates to data science.

Enjoy reading !
