I studied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Microengineering respectively in France and in Switzerland for five years. As I was studying I was teaching Mathematics to high school students ( junior to senior ). I took as much as I could from this experience and really enjoyed teaching and talking in public. I left Switzerland a while ago to keep on challenging myself and to push my limits. Since then, I have been working on Data Science projects that I write mostly in Python.

On this site you will find reports of the forementioned projects, classes, and lessons in the form of Jupyter Notebooks to help anyone with a high school education and a high motivation to understand the principles behind machine learning.

Enjoy reading !
